Absolutely — here’s a clean, student-friendly section you can paste directly into your `README.md` to help them start both the frontend and backend manually from the terminal:

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

This project has two parts:
- A **Flask backend** (Python)
- A **React frontend** (JavaScript)

You’ll need to start each one in its own terminal tab or window.

---

### ▶️ 1. Start the Backend (Flask)

In a terminal:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate       # Activate virtual environment
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000
```

This starts the API server at:  
📡 `http://localhost:5000`

> ⚠️ If you're on Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source ...`

---

### ▶️ 2. Start the Frontend (React)

In a **new terminal** tab or window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install        # Only needed once
npm start
```

This starts the React app at:  
🌐 `http://localhost:3000`

---

### 🔗 The React frontend will automatically call the Flask API at port 5000.  
Make sure both servers are running at the same time!

Let me know if you'd like to include instructions for setting up the Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv` etc.) too.
